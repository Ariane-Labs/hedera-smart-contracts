# ADR 007: Token helper wrappers placement and naming

## Context and problem statement

The repo includes core HTS contracts and several helper wrappers:
`TokenCreateContract`, `TokenCreateCustomContract`, `TokenManagementContract`, `TokenQueryContract`, and `TokenTransferContract`.
They are used in tests and examples, but they are not part of the main HTS logic.
We must decide if we keep them, move them, or remove them.

## Decision drivers

* Keep the package clean and clear
* Avoid extra maintenance of non-core code

## Considered options

1. **Remove the wrappers**  (recommended)
2. **Keep them in `/examples`**
3. **Rename and move them as optional extensions**

## Option 1: Remove the wrappers

## Consequences

### Positive

* Makes the package smaller and simpler.
* No confusion about what is supported.

### Negative

* Breaks some tests; we would have to remove or rewrite them.

## Option 2: Keep them in `/examples`

## Consequences

### Positive

* No changes needed now.

### Negative

* Looks unofficial and may be used in production by mistake.
* Still adds maintenance work.

## Option 3: Rename and move them as optional extensions

* Rename to `HTSTokenCreate`, `HTSTokenCreateCustom`, `HTSTokenManagement`, `HTSTokenQuery`, `HTSTokenTransfer`.
* Move to `/contracts/extensions/...`.
* Mark as **experimental** in docs.

## Consequences

### Positive

* Clear that they are extra tools.
* Tests keep working after small import updates.

### Negative

* More code to maintain long-term.

## Decision outcome

We will use **Option 1**.
We will remove these wrappers from the package.
If needed, we can keep examples in a separate repository.
