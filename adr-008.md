# ADR 008: HAS and HSS wrappers placement and naming

## Context and problem statement

The repo includes several helper wrappers related to the **Hedera Account Service (HAS)** and **Hedera Schedule Service (HSS)**:
`CryptoAllowance`, `CryptoOwner`, `AliasAccountUtility`, and `HRC755Contract`.
These contracts are mainly used in examples and tests to show how to use precompiles.
They are not part of the core logic of the Hedera Token Service (HTS) package.
We must decide if we keep them, move them, or remove them.

## Decision drivers

* Keep the package simple and focused on HTS
* Avoid maintaining non-core example wrappers
* Keep example usage available for reference elsewhere

## Considered options

1. **Remove the wrappers**  (recommended)
2. **Keep them in `/examples`**
3. **Rename and move them as optional extensions**

## Option 1: Remove the wrappers

## Consequences

### Positive

* Makes the npm package smaller and focused only on HTS.
* No confusion about what is supported or maintained.

### Negative

* Some example tests will stop working and need to be removed or rewritten.

## Option 2: Keep them in `/examples`

## Consequences

### Positive

* No immediate work needed.
* Examples stay available for developers to study.

### Negative

* Still unclear if they are supported or maintained.
* Might be mistaken for production-ready contracts.

## Option 3: Rename and move them as optional extensions

* Rename `CryptoAllowance`, `CryptoOwner`, and `AliasAccountUtility` to start with `HAS` prefix, for example `HASCryptoAllowance`.
* Rename `HRC755Contract` to `HSSHRC755`.
* Move them to `/contracts/extensions/`.
* Mark them as **experimental** in the documentation.

## Consequences

### Positive

* Clear that these are optional helpers.
* Tests and examples can still use them after small import updates.

### Negative

* Adds extra maintenance work for contracts outside of core scope.

## Decision outcome

We will use **Option 1**.
The wrappers `CryptoAllowance`, `CryptoOwner`, `AliasAccountUtility`, and `HRC755Contract` will be removed from the package.
They can remain available in a separate examples repository for demonstration and learning purposes.
