# ADR 001: Migrate System Contracts to Dedicated Repository

## Context and Problem Statement

Currently, Hedera's system contracts are stored in the repository [Ariane-Labs/hedera-smart-contracts](https://github.com/Ariane-Labs/hedera-smart-contracts). However, this repository also contains various examples, unrelated tools, and miscellaneous resources. As a result, potential users lack a clear understanding of the core functionality and how to effectively use it.

We need to decide whether to continue using the existing repository or create a new dedicated repository for Hedera System Contracts.

## Decision Drivers

- Need to publish an NPM package that provides essential code for testing and building smart contracts that interact with the Hedera ecosystem
- Clear separation between production-ready contracts and examples/tools
- Support for the latest major releases of Foundry or Hardhat
- Ease of versioning and maintenance
- Developer experience and usability

## Considered Options

1. Continue using the existing repository
2. **Create a new dedicated repository for Hedera System Contracts** (recommended)

## Decision Outcome

**Chosen option:** Create a new dedicated repository for Hedera System Contracts (e.g., `hiero/system-contracts`).

### Rationale

A dedicated repository provides clear ownership and purpose focused solely on Hedera System Contracts. This approach is similar to [OpenZeppelin Contracts](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts), making it easy for developers to find, use, and contribute.

### Scope of Migration

System contracts (located in `contracts/system-contracts` directory) will be migrated to the new repository.

The current repository will remain as a space for examples, tools, and experiments, but will not be the source of the NPM library.

## Consequences

### Positive

- Clear scope and purpose (System Contracts only)
- Easy for developers to find, use, and contribute
- Simplifies versioning, packaging, and publishing to package managers
- Enables concise documentation and guided examples
- Lower risk of mixing educational materials with production code

### Negative

- Requires migration effort
- Need to update existing references and documentation

## Implementation Notes

- Proposed NPM package name: `@hashgraph/contracts`
- The new repository will follow a standardized and developer-friendly layout (see ADR-002)
- Testing strategy will be addressed in ADR-003, ADR-004
- Artifacts and ABIs will not be included in version control

## Decision Outcome

We propose creating a new dedicated repository for Hedera System Contracts.
