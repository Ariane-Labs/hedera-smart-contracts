# ADR 005: Airdrop wrapper placement and naming

## Context and problem statement

The repo includes core HTS contracts (`HederaTokenService.sol`, `IHederaTokenService.sol`) and an `Airdrop` helper contract.
This helper is used in tests and examples, but it is not part of the main HTS logic.
We must decide if we keep it, move it, or remove it.

## Decision drivers

* Keep tests working
* Keep the package clean and clear

## Considered options

1. **Remove the wrapper**  (recommended)
2. **Keep it in `/examples`**
3. **Rename and move it as an optional extension**

## Option 1: Remove the wrapper

## Consequences

### Positive

* Makes the package smaller.

### Negative

* Breaks some tests, we would have to remove them.

## Option 2: Keep it in `/examples`

## Consequences

### Positive

* No changes needed now.

### Negative

* Looks unofficial.

## Option 3: Rename and move it as an optional extension

* Rename `Airdrop` -> `HTSAirdrop`.
* Move it to `/contracts/extensions/HTSAirdrop.sol`.
* Mark it as **experimental** in docs.

## Consequences

### Positive

* Clear that it is an additional tool.
* Tests keep working after small import updates.

### Negative

* A little effort required to fix the tests after an update.

## Decision outcome

We will use **Option 1**. We can keep the examples in separate repository.
