# ADR 005: Testing Framework Selection for System Contracts Repository

## Context and Problem Statement

The Hedera System Contracts will require testing infrastructure (in a separate repository per ADR-004). We need to choose which smart contract testing framework(s) to support for development, validation, and example implementations.

The two most popular testing frameworks in the Ethereum ecosystem are:
- **Hardhat**: JavaScript/TypeScript-based, widely adopted, extensive plugin ecosystem
- **Foundry**: Solidity-based, fast execution, growing adoption

We need to decide whether to support one framework or both.

## Decision Drivers

- Developer adoption and community preferences
- Ease of onboarding for new users
- Testing speed and developer experience
- Maintenance overhead for the project
- Compatibility with different development workflows
- Support for the latest features and tooling

## Considered Options

### Option 1: Support Only Hardhat (Recommended)

Support Hardhat as the single testing framework for the System Contracts repository.

**Pros:**
- **Market dominance**: Hardhat is the most widely adopted testing framework in the Ethereum ecosystem
- **Simpler maintenance**: Single framework means less complexity and maintenance overhead
- **JavaScript/TypeScript ecosystem**: Leverages familiar tools for most developers
- **Extensive plugin ecosystem**: Rich set of plugins for various needs
- **Better documentation**: More tutorials, guides, and community resources available
- **Easier onboarding**: Most developers already know Hardhat
- **Consistent tooling**: Single set of commands and workflows
- **Lower CI/CD complexity**: Only one framework to test against
- **Industry standard**: Used by major projects like OpenZeppelin, Uniswap, Aave

**Cons:**
- **Slower test execution**: JavaScript-based tests are slower than Foundry's Solidity tests
- **Excludes Foundry users**: Developers who prefer Foundry may have friction
- **Less modern**: Foundry is considered more modern by some in the community
- **No Solidity testing**: Cannot write tests in Solidity
- **Heavier dependencies**: Requires Node.js ecosystem

### Option 2: Support Only Foundry

Support Foundry as the single testing framework for the System Contracts repository.

**Pros:**
- **Fast execution**: Significantly faster test runs due to Rust-based implementation
- **Solidity-native testing**: Write tests in Solidity, keeping everything in one language
- **Modern tooling**: Built from the ground up with modern practices
- **Growing adoption**: Rapidly gaining popularity, especially among new projects
- **Built-in fuzzing**: Excellent property-based testing capabilities
- **Better gas reporting**: More detailed and accurate gas usage reporting
- **Lightweight**: No Node.js dependencies required

**Cons:**
- **Smaller user base**: Less adoption compared to Hardhat
- **Fewer resources**: Less documentation, tutorials, and community support
- **Learning curve**: Developers familiar with Hardhat need to learn new tooling
- **Plugin ecosystem**: Smaller ecosystem compared to Hardhat
- **Less mature**: Newer framework with potentially more breaking changes
- **Limited JavaScript integration**: Harder to integrate with JavaScript-based tools
- **Compatibility concerns**: Some developers may not have Rust toolchain installed

### Option 3: Support Both Hardhat and Foundry

Support both frameworks in parallel, allowing users to choose their preference.

**Pros:**
- **Maximum flexibility**: Developers can use their preferred framework
- **Broader adoption**: Attracts users from both communities
- **Cross-validation**: Both frameworks validate the contracts
- **Future-proof**: Hedges against framework popularity shifts
- **Best of both worlds**: Fast Foundry tests + comprehensive Hardhat ecosystem

**Cons:**
- **Double maintenance burden**: Need to maintain configurations and tests for both
- **Complex CI/CD**: Must run tests in both frameworks, doubling pipeline time
- **Potential inconsistencies**: Tests may behave differently across frameworks
- **Documentation overhead**: Need to document both frameworks thoroughly
- **Increased complexity**: More moving parts to manage
- **Risk of drift**: Tests in one framework may not be updated in the other
- **Higher barrier for contributors**: Contributors need to understand both frameworks
- **Version management**: Need to keep both frameworks updated

## Decision Outcome

**Chosen option:** Support only Hardhat (Option 1).

### Rationale

Hardhat provides the best balance of adoption, ecosystem support, and simplicity:

1. **Industry standard**: Hardhat is the de facto standard in the Ethereum ecosystem, used by the majority of projects
2. **Target audience alignment**: Most Hedera developers building smart contracts are already familiar with Hardhat
3. **Simplified maintenance**: Supporting a single framework reduces complexity and maintenance overhead
4. **Existing patterns**: The current `hedera-smart-contracts` repository already uses Hardhat extensively
5. **Plugin ecosystem**: Hardhat's extensive plugin ecosystem provides solutions for most needs
6. **Practical choice**: Given that tests will be in a separate repository (per ADR-004), a single framework is sufficient
7. **OpenZeppelin alignment**: Following the same tooling as OpenZeppelin Contracts

### Implementation Strategy

Since tests and examples are not included in the repository (per ADR-004), this decision primarily affects:
- The separate test repository that will be created
- Development and validation workflows
- Documentation and integration guides in the main repository

## Consequences

### Positive

- Clear, single framework for all development and testing
- Lower maintenance overhead
- Easier onboarding for contributors
- Consistent with most existing Hedera smart contract projects
- Leverages extensive Hardhat ecosystem and community support
- Simpler CI/CD pipeline
- Better documentation availability

### Negative

- Developers who prefer Foundry may face friction
- Slower test execution compared to Foundry
- Cannot leverage Foundry's modern features (fuzzing, gas reporting)
- May need to reconsider if Foundry becomes the dominant framework
- Limited to JavaScript/TypeScript for testing

## Implementation Notes

- **Separate test repository**: Create a dedicated test repository with Hardhat configuration
- **Documentation**: Include Hardhat usage examples in the main repository README
- **CI/CD**: Set up GitHub Actions to run Hardhat tests in the test repository
- **Migration path**: If Foundry support is needed in the future, it can be added to the test repository
- **Configuration**: Use standard Hardhat configuration compatible with latest releases
- **Dependencies**: Use Hardhat plugins for gas reporting, coverage, and other common needs
