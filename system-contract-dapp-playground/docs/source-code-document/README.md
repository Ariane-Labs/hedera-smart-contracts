# Source code documentation

## Overview

The `System Contract DApp Playground` project, often referred to as the DApp or DApp Playground, has been developed using a stack comprising the `React library`, `Next.js framework`, `Tailwind CSS`, and the `Chakra UI component library`. The primary objective behind this project is to provide developers with a seamless and user-friendly platform for interacting with Hedera's system contracts. The project's core purpose is to simplify the process, minimize complexities, shorten learning curves, and ultimately save valuable time for developers.

## Purpose

This document is intended to offer a thorough and elucidating account of the code components encompassed within the DApp, facilitating a deeper understanding of its inner workings.

## Goals

Offers a concise and accessible overview of the code components as well as provides a clear understanding of the codebase. This serves as a valuable resource for individuals interested in contributing to the project, enabling them to quickly grasp its structure and functionalities.
